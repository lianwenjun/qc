##Usage and Configuration

###Usage

By default, LogViewer will register itself a couple of routes:

 * `logviewer` -> Redirect to today's log, showing all levels.
 * `logviewer/$app/$sapi/$date/delete` -> Delete log from `$sapi` (see: [php\_sapi\_name](http://php.net/manual/en/function.php-sapi-name.php)) on `$date` (`Y-m-d` format).
 * `logviewer/$app/$sapi/$date/$level?` -> Show log from `$sapi` on `$date` with `$level` (if not supplied, defaults to all).

LogViewer also registers a couple filters: 

 * `logviewer.logs`: aggregates all the logs in your configured monitored directories and shares them with the `$logs` variable.
 * `logviewer.messages`: Checks if there are success, error, or info flash messages in the session and sets the `$has_messages` variable as true or false.

###Configuration

 * `base_url`: The URL LogViewer will be available on. You can have this nested (for example: `admin/logviewer`). Default: `logviewer`.
 * `filters`: Before and After filters to apply to the routes. We define no filters by default, as not everyone uses authentication or the same filter names.
   * `global`: Filters that affect the entirety of the logviewer. For example: `'global' => array('before' => 'auth'),` will apply the default Laravel `auth` filter to the logviewer, requiring a logged in user for all routes.
   * `view`: Filters that affect the viewing of log files.
   * `delete`: Filter that affect the deletion of log files.
 * `log_dirs`: Associative array of log directories to monitor. Array keys are the 'names' of your applications, values are the paths to their `app/storage/logs` dir (no trailing slash). Default: `array('app' => storage_path().'/logs')`.
 * `log_order`: Order log contents ascending or descending. Default: 'asc'.
 * `per_page`: The number of log messages to show per page via Pagination. Default: 10.
 * `view`: The name (and location) of the view used to display logs. For more information, check out the 'Advanced Usage' section for detailed information about the variables passed to this view. Default: 'logviewer::viewer'.
 * `p_view`: The pagination view to use. When using Bootstrap 3 as the default for an application, the pagination would be broken within LogViewer. If you create your own view, be sure to change this if you use Bootstrap 3 (or write your own pagination view) Default: 'pagination::slider'.

## Advanced Usage

 * `$has_messages`: Boolean. The `logviewer.messages` filter determines if there are success, error, or info flash messages in the session. Used to hide the flash messages container.
 * `$logs`: Array. Aggregated logs, generated by the `logviewer.logs` filter, from all monitored applications. Grouped by SAPI and application. Structure:
   * SAPI as key, value is an array with keys:
     * `sapi`: Human-readable SAPI.
     * `logs`: Application 'short name' as key, value is an array of log dates.
 * `$log`: Array. Currently selected log's contents. Each message is split into an array. Structure:
   * `level`: String. The level of the log message.
   * `header`: String. The first line of the log message.
   * `stack`: String. The rest of the log message. Possibly blank, if the message did not contain a stack trace.
 * `$empty`: Boolean. Whether the current log is empty or not.
 * `$date`: String. The date of the currently selected log.
 * `$sapi`: String. The human-readable SAPI of the currently selected log.
 * `$sapi_plain`: String. The SAPI of the currently selected log. Used in the URI.
 * `$url`: String. The base URL from configuration.
 * `$levels`: Array. All possible log levels, per `psr/log`.
 * `$path`: String. The array key of the currently selected log's application.
